# Todos

This is a Vue.js project called "Todos" that I created as a practice project to improve my Vue.js skills. The project allows users to add, update and delete todos, with laravel backend project called **_Todo Api_** that you will find in my Repos.

## Features

The Todo project has the following features:

- Add a todo
- Edit a todo
- Delete a todo
- Check a todo ***with double click***

## Installation

To run the project, you need to have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [here ↗](https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node.js installed, clone this repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/ibraheemz/Todo-App.git
```

Then, navigate to the project directory and install the project dependencies:

```
cd Todo-App
npm install
```

## Usage

To start the Vue.js development server, run the following command:

```
npm run serve
```

This will start the development server and open the project in your default browser at [http://localhost:8080/ ↗](http://localhost:8080/).
